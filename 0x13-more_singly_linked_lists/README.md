# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

This directory contains the tasks of the "0x13. C - More singly linked lists" at Holberton School.

## General Objectives

* How to use linked lists.

### Basic info

Linked List is a linear data structure, its elemnts are not stored at a contiguous location as in arrays; the elements are linked using pointers.

* Linked lists have dynamic size.
* Is easy to add or dilete elements.
* Random access is not allowed.
* Each pointer needs to be allocated in the memory so extra space is needed.

A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
1) data
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node.
