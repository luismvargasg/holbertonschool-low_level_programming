# C - Makefiles

> This directory contains all the tasks of the project "0x1C. C - Makefiles" at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com "Holberton School.") for educational purpose.

## General Objectives

* What are make, Makefiles.
* When, why and how to use Makefiles.
* What are rules and how to set and use them.
* What are explicit and implicit rules.
* What are the most common / useful rules.
* What are variables and how to set and use them.

## Basic info

Makefile is one of the easiest ways to automatize the process of running and compilation of programs, Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. Though integrated development environments and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems.
