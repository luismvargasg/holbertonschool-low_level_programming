## General Objectives

* What is a search algorithm.
* What is a linear search.
* What is a binary search.
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs.

## Basic info

In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values.
